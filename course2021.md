## 2021 Course Description

<!-- <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<strong>Important!</strong> The course for the 2021 edition of Pinyons and Pines coming soon!
</div> -->

Pinyons and Pines is an underground self-supported bikepacking race that starts and ends in [Flagstaff, AZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona) (6,910 feet). The route is a magnificent tour of Northern Arizona, utilizing a mixture of singletrack, double track, and dirt roads.  The start and finish are at [Flagstaff Bicycle Revolution](http://flagbikerev.com), located at 3 South Mikes Pike, sandwiched between [Pizzicletta](http://www.pizzicletta.com) and [Mother Road Brewery](https://www.motherroadbeer.com). The 2021 edition of Pinyons and Pines will start at 6:00AM on **Thursday, May 20**. The course changes each year and for 2021 we are going to mix things up a bit. This year’s course will be roughly 300 miles and will consist of one big southern loop. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which will still be an issue in May, we will cap the total number of riders at 50. Riders will also be required to wear masks and use hand sanitizer when resupplying. The race organizer is [Dana Ernst](http://danaernst.com). Please [contact me](mailto:ernst.tribe@gmail.com) with any questions or concerns.

Flagstaff sits at the base of the [San Francisco Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Peaks), on homelands sacred to Native Americans throughout the region.  The Peaks, which includes [Humphreys Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphreys_Peak) (12,633 feet), the highest point in Arizona, have religious significance to several Native American tribes. In particular, the Peaks form the [Diné](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo) (Navajo) sacred mountain of the west, called Dook'o'oosłííd, which means "the summit that never melts". The [Hopi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi) name for the Peaks is Nuva'tukya'ovi, which translates to "place-of-snow-on-the-very-top".  This year's course traverses the ancestral homelands of the [Hopi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi), [Ndee/Nnēē](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Apache_people) (Western Apache), [Yavapai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yavapai), [A:shiwi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuni_people) (Zuni Pueblo), and [Diné](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo) (Navajo). We honor their past, present, and future generations, who have lived here for millennia and will forever call this place home.

**Important!** This is an unsanctioned event. There are no fees, no prizes, but all attempts will be made to record your finish time in comparison to others. A start time and route are provided and it is up to the participant to understand the route. Riders have full responsibility for their navigation and well being. The goal is to finish the entire route while setting your own pace.

Here is a draft of the proposed route for 2021.

### Route Information

This year's route is a departure from what we've done the past two years. The current draft is 312 miles with 25,000 feet of climbing. The intention is to do the loop in the counterclockwise direction, but perhaps we can let folks choose which way to go.  Some general comments:

- I've added POIs for potential water sources, but it's important to point out that these are potential and not guarantees.  I suggest reading the notes I added to each POI. In particular, there's no guarantee that the water spigots at the campgrounds will be turned on during the race.  Obviously, I will update as I get more beta.
- The route will pass through the towns of Parks, Jerome, Camp Verde, Strawberry, and Pine.  In addition, Mormon Lake Village isn't too far off route.
- The first half of the route is spectacular in my opinion.  The section on Mingus Mountain after Jerome is particularly awesome.  I hope most of you can see this part during daylight. There isn't much single track on the first half, but you will not be disappointed.
- The current draft has 10+ miles of pavement near Camp Verde.  There is a good shoulder for pretty much all of this. I may look for ways to minimize pavement on this section, but I actually think you'll thank me when you are on this portion of the route. Prior to this isn't easy and right after isn't easy either.
- The Camp Verde area has the potential to be the warmest part of the course, but I'm hoping that most people will be passing through during the evening on the first day or early I the morning on the second day, so I think it'll be perfect.
- The second half of the course has a lot of single track on it and will certainly take longer than the first half.
- There is some hike-a-bike around miles 193-196 as we gain the Mogollon Rim.
- You are allowed to camp along the first 10 miles of Fossil Springs Road, but after mile 10, you are not allowed to camp for roughly the next 10 miles (miles 153.6-164).

I will post more details once the route is finalized.
